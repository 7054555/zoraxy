# Capture Modes

As you can see in the Introspect section, there are two types of capture mode in Zoraxy plugin API.

- Static Capture Mode
- Dynamic Capture Mode

**Notes: When this document mention the term "endpoint", it means a particular sub-path on the plugin side. For example `/capture` or `/sniff`. In actual implementation, this can be a `http.HandleFunc` or `http.Handle` depends on the plugin implementation.** 

## Static Capture Mode

Static Capture Mode register a static path to Zoraxy, when the plugin is enalbed on a certain HTTP proxy rule, all request that matches the static capture registered paths are forwarded to the plugin without asking first.

## Dynamic Capture Mode

Dynamic Capture Mode register two endpoints to Zoraxy. 

1. DynamicCaptureSniff - The sniffing endpoint where Zoraxy will first ask if the plugin want to handle this request
2. DynamicCaptureIngress - The handling endpoint, where if the plugin reply the sniffing with "YES", Zoraxy forward the incoming request to this plugin at this defined endpoint.
