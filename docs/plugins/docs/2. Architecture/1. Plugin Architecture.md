The Zoraxy Plugin uses a 3 steps approach to get information from plugin, setup the plugin and forward request to plugin. The name of the steps are partially referred from dbus designs as followings.

1. Introspect
2. Configure
3. Forwarding

The overall flow looks like this.

This design make sure that the Zoraxy plugins do not depends on platform dependent implementations that uses, for example, unix socket. This also avoided protocol that require complex conversion to and from HTTP request (data structure) like gRPC, while making sure the plugin can be cross compile into different CPU architecture or OS environment with little to no effect on its performance.
