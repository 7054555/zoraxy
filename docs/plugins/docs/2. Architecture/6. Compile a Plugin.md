# Compile a Plugin

A plugin is basically a go program with a HTTP Server / Listener. The steps required to build a plugin is identical as building a ordinary go program. 

```bash
# Assuming you are currently inside the root folder of your plugin
go mod tidy
go build

# Validate if the plugin is correctly build using -introspect flag
./{{your_plugin_name}} -introspect

# You should see your plugin information printed to STDOUT as JSON string
```
