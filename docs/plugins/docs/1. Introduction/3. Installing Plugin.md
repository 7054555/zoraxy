### Install via Plugin Store

(Work in progress)

### Manual Install

The plugin shall be placed inside the `plugins/{{plugin_name}}/` directory where the binary executable name must be matching with the plugin name.

If you are on Linux, also make sure Zoraxy have the execution permission of the plugin. You can use the following command to enable execution of the plugin binary on Linux with the current user (Assume Zoraxy is run by the current user)

```bash
cd ./plugins/{{plugin_name}}/
chmod +x ./{{plugin_name}}
```



Sometime plugins might come with additional assets other than the binary file. If that is the case, extract all of the plugins content into the folder with the plugin's name. 

After the folder structure is ready, restart Zoraxy. If you are using systemd for Zoraxy, use `sudo systemctl restart zoraxy` to restart Zoraxy via systemd service.
